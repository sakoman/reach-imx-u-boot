U-Boot for Reach Technology G2H MX6 boards

This file contains information for the port of U-Boot to the Reach
G2H boards.

1. Booting from the SD card
---------------------------

1a) Building U-Boot for SD card boot

- Build U-Boot for Reach G2H board (using G2H 7" display board as
an example):

$ make mrproper
$ make g2h_7_defconfig
$ make

This will generate the u-boot.imx binary.

1b) Booting from the SD card

- Flash the u-boot.imx binary into the SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=1; sync

- Insert the SD card into the J12 slot.

- Let pins 2-3 of jumper JP1 in the open position

- Power up the board and U-boot messages should come up in the console

2. Booting from the SPI NOR flash
---------------------------------

2a) Building U-Boot for SPI NOR flash boot

- Build U-Boot for Reach G2H board (using G2H 7" display board as
an example):

$ make mrproper
$ make g2h_7_spi_nor_defconfig
$ make

This will generate the u-boot.imx binary.

2b) Flashing U-Boot in the SPI NOR

Copy u-boot.imx to the exported TFTP directory of the host
PC (/tftpboot , for example).

=> sf probe

=> setenv serverip <server_ip_address>

=> setenv ipaddr <board_ip_address>

=> tftp 0x12000000 u-boot.imx

=> sf erase 0x0 0x80000

=> sf write 0x12000000 0x400 0x80000

- Close pins 2-3 of jumper JP1

- Power up the board and U-boot messages should come up in the console
